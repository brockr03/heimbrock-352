<h2 class="aboutmetitle">Is an investigative reporter and extremism researcher.</h2>
<br><br>
<p>I am an award-winning investigative journalist and scholar based in Washington, D.C. My work focuses on the intersections of race, class and violence as well as exploring precarity or life in the margins. 
<br><br>
    In 2025, I graduated cum laude from Whitman College with honors in Religion and Indigeneity, Race and Ethnicity Studies. During my time at Whitman, as a three-time Louis B. Perry Research Award recipient, I worked closely with Zahi Zalloua, the Cushing Eells Professor of Philosophy and Literature, on urgent questions of reason, ressentiment and justice. My's work appears in two of Zalloua's recent books, "The Politics of the Wretched" and "Fanon, Žižek, and the Violence of Resistance," as well as the 2023 issue of Crisis and Critique.
<br><br>
    From 2024-25, I spent six months conducting participatory ethnographuc research on the Walla Walla Valley Cowboy Church, culminating in an Honors thesis exploring the intersections of race, gender and power in this growing religious movement. An article bringing this research into conversation with Freud is forthcoming in Parapraxis Magazine. My work at the intersections of race, gender and power has appeared in Teen Vogue and the online Feminist Theory Journal. 

    <br><br> 
    My second Honors thesis in Indigeneity, Race and Ethnicity Studies provided a critical account of the 'zone of nonbeing' and Black life beyond precarity in Jordan Peele's film 'Us.' This paper argued that only by embracing the zone of nonbeing can truly revolutionary action take place, much like the ultimate break between the 'tethered' and their others in 'Us.'

<br><br>
    My work also led me to testify in front of the FDA, urging their support in bringing oral birth control over-the-counter. This testimony, alongside the testimony of other young advocates and public health experts, was crucial to the FDA's ultimate approval of the first-ever 'OTC' birth control pill. My testimony (and the ensuing victory for reproductive justice) was covered by Elle Magazine, Ms. Magazine and The New York Times. Now, I continue to advocate for unrestricted access to birth control for free; for anyone who needs it. 
<br><br>
    As news editor for my undergraduate student paper The Wire, I uncovered a sealed state attorney general investigation into my school for alleged Title IX and campus safety violations, uncovering a pattern of abuse by school officials, and spotlighting victims' voices in the process. For this work, I was awarded the Society of Professional Journalists' regional Mark of Excellence Award.

    <br><br>
    I am currently pursuing my Masters in Journalism at the University of Maryland, where I am also a fellow at the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, where I am working to continuing critical engagement with structures of power.
